            <h2> About Me </h2>
            <p> Born and raised on the sunny east coast of Australia, my inherent curiosity has taken me world over and currently has me based in the eclectic and creative city of Bristol, UK. </p>
            <p> Pre- UX Design, I have had a varied professional career which has allowed me to develop a board range of experience on which to draw from. I have worked in Marketing for Regional Tourism & Events, Healthcare and Education, been an
              Events Coordinator for all manner of occasions, worked overseas as a TEFL English Teacher, coordinated international travel bookings as a Travel Agent, had various roles in both Hospitality and Retail and even worked on a number of
              short film productions as a Production Coordinator. While happy working on both solo projects or as part of a team, I thrive in an interactive environment with opportunities for real connection. I love working with people, be that
              individuals or communities, to understand what their needs are, uncover what challenges they are facing and develop the best solutions to enable them to move towards their ultimate end goal. </p>
            <p> Above all things I am passionate about learning - be that mastering a new skill, studying a new topic or opening the mind to different ideas, perspectives and cultures. I have a hands on approach to life and a fundamental ‘Can-Do’
              Aussie attitude to draw on when faced with a problem to solve. I have experienced living in four different cultures, travelled extensively and met with people from all walks to life. Everyone I’ve met has in some way, big or small,
              helped to shape my world view and understanding, and reminded me remain open to shifting perspective in order to see a situation through the eyes of another. The biggest hope I have is for my work to have a positive benefit in the lives
              of those it may impact! </p>
            <p> Of a weekend I can most often be found wandering around a local makers or famers market, coffee in had and tote bag at the ready to be filled with whatever treasures there are to be found! I love to travel when I can and explore new
              places, but am equally happy whittling away the hours snuggled up with a good book or movie.</p>
