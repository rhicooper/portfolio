          <h4> Research </h4>
          <p> After conducting a competitor analysis, user surveys and user interviews with a cross section of potential users, the following findings were compiled; </p>
          <ul>
            <li> The amount of planning that goes in to a tattoo varies greatly between people, and even then between individual tattoos. Seems largely dependent on personal attitudes towards tattoos. </li>
            <li> Everyone has a different process for getting a tattoo, but generally will consider the same elements. </li>
            <li> Methods of finding tattoo inspiration varies between users, from those who enjoy browsing and those who like to search for particular items through specific searches - both will need to be catered for. </li>
            <li> Users would like to save their inspiration images so they can go back to them and reference them at a later time and need a function to easily do this. </li>
            <li> Users don’t want to go too far out of their way to get a tattoo, if they can find a reputable tattoo artist/studio nearer to their location. </li>
            <li> Help when searching is a recurring interest - whether filtering searches or providing search options - and is dependent on how users like to search for inspiration. </li>
          </ul>

          <h4> Ideation </h4>
          <p> Through my research, two clear user personas took shape - ‘The Newbie’ and ‘The Enthusiast’. While both had similar end goals, these two personas had different ways of going about researching their tattoos and the emphasis of their
            research was placed in different areas - either design inspiration, or tattoo artist. </p>
          <p> User journey maps were created for both user personas in order to develop an insight into their tasks, thoughts and emotions they may experience while
            undertaking specific tasks with the app. By imagining what entry points and journey my user persona’s would need to navigate to complete a task, I was able to develop user flows to map out the entire journey from entry point to task
            completion. This helped to establish specific screen and processes that would be required, and began to inform the Information Architecture of the app. </p>
          <p> With the most crucial app screens having been established through the User Flow process, I could begin to develop the Site Map and information architecture of the InkTank app. Once the initial structure was developed, a Card Sort
            process enabled further clarification on how users would naturally group elements of the
            app in the most instinctual way. </p>
          <p> The Similarity Matrix showed that by and large, users grouped the elements of the app in the same manner - these groupings supported the overarching structure that had been suggested. The card sort process
            did provide further insights into how users would navigate the app and allowed the overall structure & Site map to be refined and optimised.

          <h4> Wireframing </h4>
          <p> Beginning with hand sketched low-fi wireframes, I was able to begin visualising the InkTank app and main elements of the app’s navigation. Once the initial screens and features were mapped out, I created mid-fidelity mockups in Balsamiq
            to add further detail before moving to Adobe XD to create a high-fidelity clickable prototype for usability testing. </p>
          <p> The goal of my usability testing was to evaluate the usability of InkTank in its present form, observing how users
            interacted through the app through a series of tasks. Through a series of five scenario-based tasks, I could measure the learnability of the app and establish any pain points users may come across when performing basic tasks, which may
            need to be addressed further. </p>
          <p> Findings were collected and collated into a rainbow spreadsheet. Only a few minor issues were identified and flagged to potentially be revised. Subsequently a round of A/B Testing was conducted with another
            set of participants, to test some of the potential changes.

          <h4> Design </h4>
          <p> Once iterations were made to the app, I was able to develop the visual design style of InkTank, combining elements of grids and spacing, visual design principles, emotional design theory, colour theory and the Material Design Guidelines
            to establish a distinct and harmonious visual style. A full accessibility evaluation was completed once the app prototype was created and it was made available for peer review. Minor edits were made following these assessments and the
            final prototype was completed. </p>

        <h2> Conclusion </h2>
        <div class="body-text">
          <h4> What went well </h4>
          <p> The initial user research provided great insight into the features our target users would need, and helped to form a solid outline for the app’s main features. Overall the process of creating this app was very smooth and received great
            feedback in user testing. </p>
          <h4> What I learned? </h4>
          <p> It was particularly interesting to see how processes that were instinctual for some users in testing were foreign to others. This made me think particularly how to simplify processes, keep a variety of user abilities in mind when
            designing and not rely on my assumptions of existing user knowledge. I also found reviewing my design from the standpoint of accessibility of particular interest, which again linked in to the need to not make assumptions about users
            pre-existing capabilities and app use knowledge. </p>
          <h4> What's next? </h4>
          <p> InkTank still has room to grow and develop further as its user base increases. Additional features to be considered further include additional development of the ‘Guides’ section and inclusion of a ‘community board’, and the addition of
            a
            direct booking system for users to book appointments with artists through the app. This would require further research and discussions with tattoo artists and studios to understand how they currently manage booking systems and how they
            would best use this feature. </p>
