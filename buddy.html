        <div class="body-text">
          <h4> Context </h4>
          <p> A four week solo project undertaken with CareerFoundry. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
          <h4> The Problem </h4>
          <p> Studing new topics, concepts and terms can be an overwhelming and time consuming task for learners. Learners need a tool that can help simplify this task and enable them to undertake their studies when and where it suits them. </p>

        <h2> Research </h2>
        <div class="body-text">
          <h4> Competitor Analysis </h4>
          <p> Before setting out on creating an app to address the given problem, it was first important to understand what products were already available on the market and evaluate their offerings for users. </p>
          <p> Three prominent study apps were selected for review and evaluated, with a summary of ‘pros’ and ‘cons’ created for each. By conducting this exercise I was able to assess three main areas; positive features of the apps that I may be able
            to incorporate in my app, any features that I may be able to improve in my app, and what (if any) gaps existed in the market that I may be able to address through the creation of this app. </p>
          <p> I conducted research on these apps by downloading them onto my mobile and going through the app from sign up to task completion, as though I was a new user on the app. This gave me a good idea on how users of my app may approach my
            designs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          <h4> User Interviews </h4>
          <p> In order to understand what features potential users would actually find useful and how they may use a study app, a round of user interviews were conducted with a variety of participants in order to gain insights from a cross section of
            the app’s potential users. This research would inform our User Personas down the line. Three participants were recruited, covering a variety of ages, professions and locations. These interviews were conducted both online and via Skype
            video calls. </p>
          <p> These interviews proved to be very insightful into the study methods and routines used by participants, and the manner in which they already used apps to study various topics. Participants also provided a number of their own suggestions
            into what features they would find useful in a study app. </p>
          <p> As this was my first time conducting user interviews, I found it challenging to balance sticking to the pre-determined interview questions and letting the interview follow a natural conversational course that could lead to previously
            unconsidered insights. In saying this however, I enjoyed conducting these interviews and they provided great insights into how potential users would use the app and what they needed from it. </p>

        <h2> Ideation </h2>
        <div class="body-text">
          <h4> User Persona </h4>
          <p> In order to put a face to my potential user and help maintain the ‘customer-first’ approach, I created a user persona with the aim to define the behaviours, needs, and goals of my average user. Through this I was able to imagine the
            context of the problems my persona ‘Rachel’ may be facing and how this app could help her face these. </p>
          <p> To do this, I devised a number of user stories and job stories for her, and ultimately defined an overarching problem statement and hypothesis statement for how this app would help her. Due to the great insight I had gathered through my
            user interviews, I found the task of defining who Rachel was and the context on how she would use this app to be quite straight forward. From this point I could start imagining in detail how ‘Rachel’ would go about using the app.

        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          <h4> User Flows </h4>
          <p> To begin structuring the app architecture, it was first important to understand what tasks Rachel would be completing on the app and the steps she would need to take from entry point to task completion. From here I was able to map out
            the user flow diagrams for these tasks, starting to add in specific in-app prompts and guides. </p>
          <p> This was a great exercise to perform before jumping into designing the app screens, as it ensured I considered every element that would be needed to perform the desired tasks through the app. As I worked through creating the user flows
            I came across a few elements I had not previously considered, and likely would not have picked up until further down the line had I not taken the time to perform this task.</p>

        <h2> Development </h2>
        <div class="body-text">
          <h4> Wireframes & Prototype </h4>
          <p> With the details and needs from my user flows in mind, I undertook a series of exercises in ‘Crazy 8s’ and ‘Dot Voting’ to begin conceiving the designs of my app screens. While I found this type of rapid designing challenging, it was a
            great way to dump out a range of ideas, concepts and layouts for the app screens that I may not otherwise have considered. </p>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/buddy/crazyeights@1.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img src="img/buddy/crazyeights@2.png" alt="Dot Voting">
          </picture>
          <p> After selecting a few of the ideas I was most drawn to exploring further, I was able to create a series of wireframes with more detailed elements. Even at this stage I came across details and elements that needed amending as I went, in
            order to put together a series of basic wireframes that I would be able to present to test participants for usability testing. I photographed and uploaded my screens onto MarvelApp I was able to create a clickable prototype for the next
            stage.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          <h4> User Testing </h4>
          <p> In order to assess whether my designs would actually be viable for implementation into an app, usability testing was the next vital step in the process. This would allow me to see how real people interacted with the app and determine
            whether it serves its intended purpose and met my original goal. Testing sessions were conducted in person with three participants from a cross section of our intended target users. </p>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/buddy/usertesting@1.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img src="img/buddy/usertesting@2.png" alt="User Test Participants">
          </picture>
          <p> Handing my designs over to test participants was a daunting task at first, however was an important step to take. The issues encountered for some users that I had not previously encountered or considered problems forced me to challenge
            my existing preconceptions of the app, stepping beyond myself to see the app from a neutral viewpoint to understand the views of the test participants. Being able to break through this mental barrier ensured I could take on the feedback
            of my test participants and ensure my designs served them in the best way possible. </p>
        </div>

        <h2> Learnings </h2>
        <div class="body-text">
          <p> Undertaking this project gave me a great insight into the steps involved in a UX project that I will be able to take with me onto future projects, including; </p>
          <ul>
            <li> Creative exercises that helped with getting out of my head and quickly testing many potential design solutions. </li>
            <li> The importance of user testing to get feedback on designs, and how your own experience/assumptions can influence your designs (either positively or negatively!) </li>
            <li> It’s important to take feedback when it is given, and be open to make changes to designs. </li>
            <li> Consistency in design is important for improving user experience. </li>
            <li> While having a script for user testing can help form the backbone of sessions, it’s important to remain open to following alternate (relevant) discussions. </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
          <h2> Future Steps </h2>
          <p> As it stands, I believe the basic prototype I have created is a great base from which to further develop an app that will ultimately fulfil the original project goal of creating a study app that assists learners to create, organise and
            review study flashcards on the go. </p>
          <p> The next steps for this project will include high-fidelity prototypes with the revisions made following usability testing, including the development of basic app UI for a more realistic experience. This prototype would go into further
            usability testing before entering development. </p>
          <p> From the first round of testing, a list of potential future iterations were made that would also be considered in future rounds of design and testing; </p>
          <ul>
            <li> Add options for collaborative study </li>
            <li> Add ability to create a study plan and reminders for study sessions </li>
            <li> Review wording used throughout the app to ensure comprehension by a wide range of users </li>
            <li> Review use of option of audio and images to flashcards and relevancy to study </li>
          </ul>
